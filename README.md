# tubechallenge
Tube Challenge planner - python 2.7

To do:
Track back to safe node when route forks e.g. at Leytonstone and sequence correctly. Limited options for this!
Allow input for different start nodes.
Sort out documentation!
Find an actual TSP approximation rather than using MSTs.
Implement randomness in next node selection (currently chooses first node encountered when shortest distance is joint).
